# Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency

Since Bitcoin was introduced in 2008, numerous blockchain-based projects have surfaced, referred to as cryptocurrencies (coin/cryptos). 

This project extensively utilizes pandas.Dataframe.plot() and the Axes API in matplotlib, my goal is to keep it readily accessible in a separate tab by using **Data Manipulation** with pandas and **Data Cleaning** in **Python**

The project uses data collected on the 6th of December 2017 when Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion. Throughout the project, I perform these tasks: 
* Compare Bitcoin with other cryptocurrencies and plot the market capitalization for the top 10 coins as barplot for better visualization.
* Visualize the volatility in cryptocurrencies (Daily and Weekly) (Some coins increase 800% daily)
* Top 10 biggest gainers and top 10 losers in cryptocurrency market capitalization.
* Classify dataset based on Investopedia's capitalization for company stocks
