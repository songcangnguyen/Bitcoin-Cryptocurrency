# Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency

Since Bitcoin was introduced in 2008, numerous blockchain-based projects have surfaced, referred to as cryptocurrencies (coin/cryptos). 

This project extensively utilizes pandas.Dataframe.plot() and the Axes API in matplotlib, my goal is to keep it readily accessible in a separate tab by using:
* **Data Manipulation** with pandas
* **Data Cleaning** in **Python**

The project uses data collected on the 6th of December 2017 when Bitcoin has a market capitalization above $200 billion.
